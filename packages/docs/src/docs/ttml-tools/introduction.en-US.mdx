## Introduction
The interface design of this tool is inspired by AegiSub and references other similar editors (such as the lyrics editor built into Kugou Music). It aims to provide users with a user-friendly lyrics creation tool. It can help you create and save lyrics files in TTML format at a low cost and with convenience. Based on the cross-platform nature of the web platform, users can complete lyrics creation on any terminal device that supports a keyboard.

*Author's Note: You can even create lyrics on your mobile phone if you're willing to tinker.*

### Interface Components

[![pFK2lYn.png](https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/01/31/pFK2lYn.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pFK2lYn)

From top to bottom:
- **Top toolbar**: Provides various basic functions such as importing text, exporting lyrics files, setting translation and transliteration, automatic segmentation, switching working modes, etc. Its functionality is the same in any mode.

- **Main workspace**: Where you perform operations such as editing lyrics, setting axes, and previewing.

- **Bottom toolbar**: Provides functions for loading music files, adjusting playback progress, adjusting playback speed, and adjusting volume. Its functionality is the same in any mode.

Lyrics creation is done on a **"word"** basis, so you need to divide a sentence into many words and set time labels for them sequentially, for the player to read, in order to display the correct lyrics text at the correct time. The following will introduce the functions and usage methods of each feature page.

***In the following text, "word" will no longer refer to the linguistic meaning of "a language unit opposed to a 'phrase,'" but to the smallest unit of operation on the text in this tool.***

The menus in the top toolbar include:
- File:
  - New Lyrics: Create a new blank lyrics file.
  - Open Lyrics: Open an existing lyrics file.

#### Editing Mode
[![pFKf7X6.png](https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/01/31/pFKf7X6.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pFKf7X6)

Here, you can import lyrics text and preprocess the text, such as segmentation, setting duet or background lyrics, setting translation, and transliteration.

[![pFKhiB8.png](https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/01/31/pFKhiB8.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pFKhiB8)

At the same time, you can adjust the order of words by dragging them.

The "empty shot" function is for multi-syllable languages such as Japanese and Korean. In Japanese, a kanji may have one or more syllables. If you set a time label for this word with one press of a button, it can easily cause some users to be unable to keep up with the rhythm of the song. So, we added this function. However, this function has not been debugged yet. Stay tuned. (GitHub [@Xionghaizi001](https://github.com/Xionghaizi001))

*Author's Note: This feature is actually quite suitable for English too.*

#### Axis Setting Mode
[![pFKh2vt.png](https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/01/31/pFKh2vt.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pFKh2vt)

Here, you can create word-by-word lyrics, setting the start and end times of each word **precisely**. Of course, you don't have to manually set them one by one; just press one of the keys `(F / G / H)`.

From top to bottom:

1. Toolbar: Here you can still switch various modes and set some attributes, but you need to return to the editing mode to view and preview.
2. Character selection box: Here you can select a specific "word" to set the axis for them. Note the green timestamp above a specific word; it indicates that you are working on that word. If you need to switch, simply click on another word in the line.
3. Main workspace: Here you can select a specific line for further operation, or click on a line to jump to the first word of that line for axis setting.
4. Bottom toolbar: You can still change the song here (if necessary), adjust progress, speed, and volume.

This tool supports keyboard operation, and here are the supported shortcut keys:
|Key|Function|
|:-:|:-:|
|A|Move to the previous word|
|D|Move to the next word|
|W|Move to the first word of the previous lyrics line|
|S|Move to the first word of the next lyrics line|
|R|Move to the previous word and set the playback position as the start time of the target word|
|Y|Move to the next word and set the playback position as the start time of the target word|
|**F**| **Record the current time as the start time of the current word**
|**G**| **Record the current time as the end time of the current word and the start time of the next word, then move to the next word**
|**H**| **Record the current time as the end time of the current word and move to the next word (used to leave space for interlude time)**
| \[ (left square bracket)|Decrease playback speed by 0.25x
| \] (right square bracket)|Increase playback speed by 0.25x
|' (apostrophe)|Set playback speed to normal
|**Space**|**Play / Pause music**

Bolded keys are commonly used.

Here, you can preview your previous efforts and check if each word lights up when it should.

# Simplest Usage

## **Before practicing the content below, we strongly recommend using wired audio devices, or the built-in speakers of your computer/phone/tablet, as their latency is negligible for humans. Most Bluetooth headphones, even in call mode, have an unacceptable delay for such latency-sensitive scenarios.**

### Preparation Stage
- Prepare the lyrics you want to create and copy them to the clipboard.

- Click on the menu bar **"File-Import Lyrics-Import from Plain Text."**

```
Common keys:
    F  Set the start time of the current word

    G  Set the end time of the current word as the playback time, move the cursor to the next word,
       then set the start time of the next word as the playback time

    H  Set the playback time as the end time of the current word and move the cursor to the next word.
       Usually used to leave space for interlude time.
```
Usually, when singing a song, you should press the **F** key to start recording the timestamp when the first word of a line is sung. Then, according to the progress of the song, continuously press the **G** key to record the timestamp of the current word and move the cursor to the next word. After singing a line, press the **H** key to mark the end of the lyrics. Flexibly using the end mark can make the lyrics have a better performance effect.
- Note that you need to ensure that you can keep up with the rhythm of the song, so you can create lyrics that match the singing effect. Otherwise, you need to use the speed control function in the lower-right corner to lower the speed so that you can keep up with the rhythm of the song.

### Completion of Production
You can choose the **"Preview Mode"** in the toolbar to preview the effect in real-time after completion or during the production process. Alternatively:
- Click on **"File-Export Lyrics"** in the menu bar to select the format you want to export.

- Click on **"File-Save Lyrics"** in the menu bar to save it as a TTML format.

- Click on **"File-Save Lyrics to Clipboard"** in the menu bar to import it into the AMLL plugin for quick preview.
